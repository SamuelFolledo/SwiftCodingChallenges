/*: ## Challenge 27: Print last lines
Difficulty: Easy
 
Write a function that accepts a filename on disk, then prints its last  N lines in reverse order, all on a single line separated by commas.
 ### Hints
 - Hint #1: Use the ```contentsOfFile``` initializer to pull in the text, then ```components(separatedBy:)``` to create an array of lines.
 - Hint #2: Arrays have a built-in ```reverse()``` method that flip them around in-place.
 - Hint #3: You need to print the last  N lines, but of course you donâ€™t want to read beyond the size of the array. Make sure you use the ```min()``` function to choose the lesser of the two.
